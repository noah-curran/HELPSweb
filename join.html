<p>We recommend reading this page fully before submitting the <a class="reference external" href="https://forms.gle/Q27KTbahpGbHMEGq8">application form</a>.
However, if you have already spoken with members of the research team, it is ok to proceed directly to the form.</p>

<p>Dr. Lu (almost every professor) receives too many meaningless messages
from careless students. In most cases, the students do not even know
where the messages are sent to. Many messages ask to join Dr. Lu’s
research team even though Dr. Lu has never done anything on the topics
of the senders’ interest. Dr. Lu will not respond to these
messages. Dr. Lu will respond to only questions from students that are
already at Purdue or have already received admissions from Purdue. If
you are not at Purdue, please contact the admission office. Dr. Lu
will not answer questions like “Can I get an admission to Purdue?” or
“Can you give me funding?”</p>
<p>Before you contact Dr. Lu, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do I know what this research team is doing?</p></li>
<li><p>Have I read this team’s recent papers and understood?</p></li>
<li><p>Do I want to conduct research on these topics?</p></li>
<li><p>Can I contribute to solving the research problems?</p></li>
<li><p>Do not send email to Dr. Lu if you have no answer. Don’t waste your time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Should you do research? Research, like any other activities that
require long-term efforts (such as marathon, chess, painting…), is
not for everyone. “Everyone should do research.” is as valid as
“Everyone should run marathon.” or “Everyone should play chess.”
Before you join a research team (any team), think about the
reasons. What do you want to accomplish? Why do you want to do
research with this team? Remember, time is your most precious
asset. Do you want to spend your time with these people? Why? Do these
people want to spend time with you? Why?</p>
<p>If you want to talk to Dr. Lu, his office is MSEE 222.</p>

<div class="section" id="still-want-to-join">
<h2>Still want to join?<a class="headerlink" href="#still-want-to-join" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you are serious about solving research problems and interested
joining the research team, please fill in <a class="reference external" href="https://forms.gle/Q27KTbahpGbHMEGq8">this Google form</a>.</p>
<p>The team’s mission is to create leaders. The research projects’ mission is to create the technologies saving lives.</p>
<p>For undergraduate students: This research team gives undergraduate
students the true experience of research. You will be given research
problems, not classroom homework assignments. You need to solve these
research problems and have contributions to the research community
(such as research papers, open-source software, data). This is a large
research team in the number of undergraduate students on Purdue
campus. You will get the opportunities learning from other students,
making life-long friends, solving problems that are too difficult for
small teams.</p>
<p>For graduate students: This team has many undergraduate students and
you can get rare experience working with these students solving large
research problems. They may help you review literature or conduct
experiments. They may critique your methods. You may get the
opportunity leading a team.</p>
<p>It is expected that you are comfortable writing computer programs. You
should have the skills equivalent to ECE 264 (or CS 240) at Purdue. CS
159 is insufficient. You must be able to learn Python.</p>
<p>Research requires a lot of self learning. If you learn in classroom
only and need step-by-step guidance by teaching assistants, you are
not ready for research.</p>
<p>This research provides unique experience that is uncommon on campus:
all students (including undergraduate students) solve research
problems. Since research problems are difficult, this team has the
following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every student is expected to stay for at least two semesters (summer
counts as a semester). Many students stay in the team for 2 years or
even longer. Why? They want to solve research problems. If you
intend to stay for only semester, do not come.  One semester is too
short to accomplish anything meaningful.</p></li>
<li><p>Every new member must pass an interview with current members.</p></li>
<li><p>Every new member will receive fast-pace training. This takes the
efforts of current members.</p></li>
<li><p>During spring or fall semester, every new member must take a
research course (ECE 279, 379, 479, CS 490, or similar). The reason
is simple: without taking a research course, new members always
vanish when their coursework becomes heavy. This wastes everyone’s
time.</p></li>
<li><p>Teamwork is absolutely critical. If you want to work alone, do not
come.</p></li>
<li><p>Every member must make a commitment to solving research
problems. This team demands serious efforts. This is a research team
and entertainment is not the purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning is an essential part of doing research but research is much
more than learning. Research must create new things (new software,
new data, new theory, new algorithms, new interpretation…). If you
do not create anything new, you are not doing research. “New” means
new to human knowledge, not new to you. If your only intention is to
“learn” without solving research problems, do not come. If you want
to learn, take classes or read books (or papers).</p></li>
<li><p>Members are expected to interact in both professional and social
settings. Many solutions are discovered when people talk outside
research laboratories. Communication with your team is an essential
part of research. The social events are important parts of member
interactions. If you do not want to participate in any social event,
do not join this research team.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a research team. It is not an amusement park. This team
solves research problems and does not host tourists. Join this team
only if you want to solve research problems. Spend at least six
hours per week on the research project and attend weekly team
meetings.</p></li>
<li><p>Report progress in writing and speaking.  Research, by definition,
is to discover new things. Thus, you must explain what you have
discovered by speaking and writing.</p>

<div class="section" id="frequently-asked-questions">
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions<a class="headerlink" href="#frequently-asked-questions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Q: It seems that you are discouraging people to join your team, why?
Will anyone actually want to join?</p></li>
<li><p>A: Too many people treat “research” as visiting an amusement
park. They are looking for “fun” without the intention of taking
efforts. They show up when they want to; they may leave at any
moment. They expect to get A easily. This research team does not
need those people. This research team welcomes only the people that
are serious about solving research problems. Many people want to
join this team because these people know everyone in this team is
serious about solving research problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: How many hours do I need to spend per week?</p></li>
<li><p>A: <strong>What do you want to accomplish?</strong> You need to spend at least
six hours a week. If you cannot, you are wasting your time because
you can accomplish nothing.  Many people spend more than six hours a
week. If you are leading a research paper, it is possible that you
spend 30 hours (or more) the week before submission.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: If I am selected, I will stay for at least two semesters, right?</p></li>
<li><p>A: Not necessarily. The team may be reorganized. A particular topic
may be eliminated if enough progress has been made. A member may be
released (not “fired”) if the member shows no progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: Your team demands a lot. What do members get?</p></li>
<li><p>A: Why do people climb high mountains? Why do people compete in
World Cup? They want to accomplish something extraordinary.  This
team gives members the pride of solving research problems,
friendship with excellent researchers, authorship (or co-authorship)
of research papers, strong recommendation letters, excellent job
offers, and occasionally, pizza.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: I do not want to take a research course because I already have
too many credits.</p></li>
<li><p>A: If you have too many credits, you will not have time doing
research. You will definitely vanish when your coursework becomes
heavy. Do not come.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: This is my last semester and I do not want to take too many credits.</p></li>
<li><p>A: If this is your last semester, you will not stay for two
semester. Do not come.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: I guarantee that I will stay, even though I do not take a research course.</p></li>
<li><p>A: You will not stay. You know very clearly. You do not want to take
a research course because you cannot spend time. Do not come. Many
people “assured” that they would stay without taking credits.
Everyone vanished. In fact, these people simply vanished without
saying “Good Bye”. This team does not need these people.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: If you are so restrictive, how many people actually apply for joining the team?</p></li>
<li><p>A: For Spring 2019, about 120 people wanted to join or stay in this
team. This team’s size has been growing rapidly in recent
semesters. Many people want to join this team because they want to
spend time with those that are serious about solving research
problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: Do you set a limit on the team’s size?</p></li>
<li><p>A: We welcome everyone that wants to solve research problems.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="about-financial-support">
<h2>About Financial Support<a class="headerlink" href="#about-financial-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Most students do not know how universities operate in terms of
finance. As a result, they think professors magically have unlimited
funds to support as many students as the professors decide. Before you
ask Dr. Lu to provide financial support, please be aware of the
following facts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Dr. Lu does not print money. Research fund does not fall from sky like rain drops.</p></li>
<li><p>Purdue University does not give students’ tuition to professors for
doing research. The tuition goes to facilities such as networks,
buildings, furniture, electricity, staff, administration, cleaning
…</p></li>
<li><p>For every $100 Dr. Lu spends on research (including machines, travel
to conferences, salary for students …), Purdue takes $55 for
facilities such as networks, buildings, furniture, electricity,
cleaning … Thus, Dr. Lu has to request $155 from project sponsors.</p></li>
<li><p>Purdue does not give research money to professors because the
professors have a lot of students.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu works with many students because he wants to give more
students research experience. He enjoys the intellectual
interactions with many excellent students. He also thinks the
interactions among students help them succeed. The size of his
research team has no effect on how much Purdue gives for research
(always $0).</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu has zero influence about how Purdue spends tuition. Please
talk to Purdue President if you have any suggestions.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu has zero influence on other professors’ decisions. Dr. Lu
cannot tell any other professor to provide any student financial
support.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu obtains research funding by writing proposals.</p></li>
<li><p>Financial supports are divided into three types: fellowship,
teaching assistantship, and research assistantship. Dr. Lu has no
control of fellowship or teaching assistantship.</p></li>
<li><p>Research assistantship is a type of employment: a research assistant
is an employee of Purdue University for conducting research
described in the corresponding research proposal.  If you do not do
what is written in the proposal, you cannot receive research
assistantship.</p></li>
<li><p>Professors provide research assistantship because the work in the
proposals have to be carried out, not because professors are “nice”.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="common-mistakes-by-students">
<h3>Common Mistakes by Students<a class="headerlink" href="#common-mistakes-by-students" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Some students think “doing research” means disappearing for five
years and coming back with world-changing discovery or invention.
It does not work that way. You need to regularly (about once a week)
report progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Financial support is free money and students have complete freedom doing whatever they want.</p></li>
<li><p>Some students go to professors and say, “Give me money.” They do not
know that, in a bank office, this is called robbery and is a crime.</p></li>
<li><p>Some students think sending emails to professors and money will be
transferred to the students’ bank accounts the next day.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="how-to-get-financial-support-from-dr-lu">
<h3>How to Get Financial Support from Dr. Lu?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-get-financial-support-from-dr-lu" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Understand that Dr. Lu has no obligation giving you financial support. You have to earn it.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting financial support from Dr. Lu will take you a lot of efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>Read at least five of his papers published in the last three
years. Do not initiate any conversation before you finish reading
the papers.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare to have multiple, long, and deep technical discussions.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu has a large established research program. You must do what
the research program needs.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu can support only Purdue students.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Lu emphasizes teamwork greatly. You have to work with a
team. You must have good communication skills.</p></li>

<p>Do you like sports? Are you ready to join a professional team that
compete internationally? This research team solves problems whose
answers are not known to anyone in the world. We compete
internationally.  We produce open-source software and data. We
publish papers in top venues.</p>
</div>
<p>This research requires that every applicant be interviewed by two or
three current members. Why?  Any organization exists for a
purpose. The organization can succeed if the members can work together
toward the common goals. The organization fails if the members do not
understand the purpose of the organization or cannot work
together. Interviews are one of the methods to help determine whether
people interested joining the organization is ready to work together
with existing members toward the common goals.</p>
<p>A research group is fundamentally different from a classroom. A
research group aims to solve research problems that can help
humanity. A classroom is usually an inclusive environment: most
instructors allow auditors. In contrast, a research team is a
“privileged” environment and only selected members can participate.
Many reasons make research team restrictive, for example,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The members in the team use the facilities that are purchased
using research fund.</p></li>
<li><p>The members must have ability to understand and improve
state-of-the-art solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>The members are inventing a new solution that may lead to a
patent. Before this patent is filed and granted, the members must
protect the intellectual properties.</p></li>
<li><p>The members are writing a research paper and everyone must be
qualified to contribute to the content.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you like sports, you need to ask yourself a simple qustion: “Am I
ready to join a professional team?” This research team is professional
because the team solves research problems that have not been solved by
anyone yet. If you are not ready to contribute, you will not enjoy the
experience and current team members cannot work with you.</p>
<p>This is a research team. You come to solve research problem. You do
not come to learn. If you want to learn, go to take courses or read
books.This team does not accept anyone that wants to join and learn,
without contributions to solving research problems. This team accepts
only the people that wants to solve research problems.The purpose of
interviews is to help applicants and current members <strong>evaluate
whether the applicants are ready to contribute.</strong></p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-an-interview">
<h3>What is an interview?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-an-interview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An interview is a two-way communication: An organization wants to
determine whether an applicant should join the organization.
Meanwhile, this applicant also evaluates whether this organization is
worth the time and efforts. An interview usually evaluates three
aspects:(1) Communication skills, (2) Technical skills, (3)
Personality, honesty, and integrity.</p>
<p>If an applicant is not ready to join the group, it is possible that
this person can join later and contribute. This research team holds
honesty and integrity as the highest requirements.If an applicant is
not honest, this team will never accept the applicant. Communication
and technical skills can be acquired. Honesty and integrity cannot be
compromised.</p>
<p>Sample questions are listed below for your reference. Your are
encouraged to study these questions in advance.  You need to prepare
for the interview.</p>

<h3>Differences between Students and Researchers<a class="headerlink" href="#differences-between-students-and-researchers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before an interview, please make sure you understand the differences
between students and researchers.  A student with high GPA is not
necessarily a good researcher. Some excellent researchers do not have
high GPA.  Why? Because taking classes are doing research are very
very different.</p>
<p>How does a student get a good grade? Usually, by submitting
assignments and answering exam questions. Due to the semester (or
quarter) structure, a course can last only 15 (or 10) weeks. As a
result, every assignment has to be finished within several
weeks. Also, most exam questions are limited to well-defined problems
that can be answered within one or two hours.  This structure has
tremendous impacts on how students think.  Many students (mistakenly)
think everything can be done within a few weeks because students never
have experience doing anything longer than a few weeks. Most students
cannot comprehend the complexity of any problem that takes more than
several weeks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, research is almost the opposite of everything in
classroom. The following table summarizes the main differences between
“student thinking” and “researcher thinking”:</p>

<h3>Interview is not an oral exam<a class="headerlink" href="#interview-is-not-an-oral-exam" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Many students think interviews are oral exams: interviewers ask
questions and interviewees answer the questions. This is incorrect.
An interview is two-way communication. An interviewee should also ask
questions. To ask meaningful questions, an interviewee should study
the characteristics of the research team. Some students think
interview questions are “fill in the blank” and provide short answers,
without much explanation. Such an interviewee is “passive”: responding
to questions without deeper thought. Such an attitude would be
considered negative. It is advisable to dig deeper by providing more
insightful information. It is perfectly reasonable for an interviewee
to ask back “Why do you ask me this question?”</p>
<p>Do not intend to prepare an interview by memorization. Good
interviewers do not ask memorization questions. Dr. Lu <em>always</em> gives
open-book exams because he <em>strongly encourages</em> understanding, not
memorization. To enter Dr. Lu’s research team, you need to demonstrate
that you can think. It is acceptable to say, “I don’t know.” and then
ask the interviewer to provide more information and guidance toward an
answer. A common mistake by students is to provide lengthy explanation
without answering the questions. Some students can take several
minutes without giving any definite answer.  Why? They are afraid
giving wrong answers. This is a bad attitude. It is better to answer
the question and then explain the reason of the answer. Interviewers
want answers before explanation. For a “Yes-No” question, answer “Yes”
or “No” first and then give the explanation.</p>
<p>Honesty is extremely important. An interviewee should never lie. If an
interviewee does not know the answer, it is acceptable to say, “I
don’t know the answer.” The interviewee should not pretend to know the
answer and say meaningless things. After admitting not knowing the
answer, an interviewee can try to answer the question through
reasoning. “I don’t know the answer but I think it should be … because
…” The “because” part is very important.</p>

helpful: data structures, discrete mathematics, algorithms, computer
