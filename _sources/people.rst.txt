Forest Inventory Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use computer vision to calculate the sizes of trees (called diameter
at breath height, or DBH), recognize the species of trees, and their
locations.  For Fall 2019, the team has two major goals: (1) handle
multiple trees in a single frame and (2) handle trees in a nautral
forest.

The following images show the result from a distance sensor and the tree image (before and after denoising).

Analysis of Drone Video
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This project creates computer vision solutions recognizing objects
captured by cameras mounted on drones.  In Fall 2019, the team will
create a set of video clips for the following purposes:

- Construct three-dimensional geometries of objects: The video clips
  will capture cardboard boxes of different sizes, together with a
  wide range of objects and several with known sizes.

- Detect and track multiple moving objects: The clips include moving
  objects.  The drone itself is also moving. The purpose is to
  correctly identify these objects and track their movements.

- Segmentation: Create pixel-wise labels of different objects.

- Re-identify people: Determine whether the same person has been
  before.

Embedded Vision 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recent progress in computer vision has focused primarily in
general-purpose object detection using datasets with many (hundreds)
categories of objects (such as humans, dogs, vehicles, furniture,
buildings, etc.).  For many applications, however, the number of
possible objects can be limited. For example, inside an airport
terminal, elephants or eagles are not expected. This project will use
**computer graphics** to synthesize images and videos of these
scenarios. The synthesized data is used to train computer vision
running on embedded systems (also called **edge devices**).  Doing so
can reduce network traffic and make the system more
scalable. Moreover, sensitive information (such as human faces) may be
detected and protected before the data leaves the cameras.

Analyze Human Behavior in Video
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The purpose of this team is to use real-time video analytics to detect
dangerous behavior or safety violation in workplace (such as
factories), raise alerts to prevent injury, or provide post-event
analysis to prevent future occurrences. In Fall 2019, the team will
focus on solving these problems in an indoor
environment with multiple cameras:

- Where are the people (including re-identifying the same person in different cameras)?

- Where does each person face?

Software Engineering for Machine Learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This project creates a process for developing **reproducible**
software used in machine learning. In Fall 2019, the team's focus is
to create tools that faciliate code review. The tools analyze the
histories of version control repositories and identify

Crowdsourcing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Computer vision is still not perfect and humans outperform computers
in many situations. This team builds computer tools (human interfaces)
for humans to identify unexpected properties (called "bias") in data
used to train computer programs. These tools are computer games and
the players (crowds) describe the characteristics in the data.

Image Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This system integrates computer vision and database.  After the
objects in images are detected, the information is stored in a
database so that it is searchable.  The team has built a prototype of
the system processing multiple video streams simultaneously. The team
will focus on improving the performance (scalability) for lower
latency as well as investigating new storage systems.

Embedded Vision 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This project investigates computer vision solutions that can perform
the following tasks in an embedded computer (small enough to be inside
a typical camera)

- Obtain aggregate information (such as the number of people and their genders)

- Detect faces

- Encrypt the faces before sending the data to storage

The sensitive data (faces) never leaves the camera.  Only authorized
people with the decryption key can see the faces. The concept is
illustrated below.
