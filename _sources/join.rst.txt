Dr. Lu (almost every professor) receives too many meaningless messages
from careless students. In most cases, the students do not even know
where the messages are sent to. Many messages ask to join Dr. Lu's
research team even though Dr. Lu has never done anything on the topics
of the senders' interest. Dr. Lu will not respond to these
messages. Dr. Lu will respond to only questions from students that are
already at Purdue or have already received admissions from Purdue. If
you are not at Purdue, please contact the admission office. Dr. Lu
will not answer questions like "Can I get an admission to Purdue?" or
"Can you give me funding?"

Before you contact Dr. Lu, ask yourself these questions:

- Do I know what this research team is doing?
  
- Have I read this team's recent papers and understood?
  
- Do I want to conduct research on these topics?
  
- Can I contribute to solving the research problems?
  
- Do not send email to Dr. Lu if you have no answer. Don't waste your time. 

Should you do research? Research, like any other activities that
require long-term efforts (such as marathon, chess, painting...), is
not for everyone. "Everyone should do research." is as valid as
"Everyone should run marathon." or "Everyone should play chess."
Before you join a research team (any team), think about the
reasons. What do you want to accomplish? Why do you want to do
research with this team? Remember, time is your most precious
asset. Do you want to spend your time with these people? Why? Do these
people want to spend time with you? Why?

If you want to talk to Dr. Lu, his office is MSEE 222.

Still want to join?

The team's mission is to create leaders. The research projects' mission is to create the technologies saving lives.

For undergraduate students: This research team gives undergraduate
students the true experience of research. You will be given research
problems, not classroom homework assignments. You need to solve these
research problems and have contributions to the research community
(such as research papers, open-source software, data). This is a large
research team in the number of undergraduate students on Purdue
campus. You will get the opportunities learning from other students,
making life-long friends, solving problems that are too difficult for
small teams.

For graduate students: This team has many undergraduate students and
you can get rare experience working with these students solving large
research problems. They may help you review literature or conduct
experiments. They may critique your methods. You may get the
opportunity leading a team.

It is expected that you are comfortable writing computer programs. You
should have the skills equivalent to ECE 264 (or CS 240) at Purdue. CS
159 is insufficient. You must be able to learn Python.

Research requires a lot of self learning. If you learn in classroom
only and need step-by-step guidance by teaching assistants, you are
not ready for research.

This research provides unique experience that is uncommon on campus:
all students (including undergraduate students) solve research
problems. Since research problems are difficult, this team has the
following requirements:

- Every student is expected to stay for at least two semesters (summer
  counts as a semester). Many students stay in the team for 2 years or
  even longer. Why? They want to solve research problems. If you
  intend to stay for only semester, do not come.  One semester is too
  short to accomplish anything meaningful.
  
- Every new member must pass an interview with current members.
  
- Every new member will receive fast-pace training. This takes the
  efforts of current members.
  
- During spring or fall semester, every new member must take a
  research course (ECE 279, 379, 479, CS 490, or similar). The reason
  is simple: without taking a research course, new members always
  vanish when their coursework becomes heavy. This wastes everyone's
  time.

- Teamwork is absolutely critical. If you want to work alone, do not
  come.

- Every member must make a commitment to solving research
  problems. This team demands serious efforts. This is a research team
  and entertainment is not the purpose.

- Learning is an essential part of doing research but research is much
  more than learning. Research must create new things (new software,
  new data, new theory, new algorithms, new interpretation...). If you
  do not create anything new, you are not doing research. "New" means
  new to human knowledge, not new to you. If your only intention is to
  "learn" without solving research problems, do not come. If you want
  to learn, take classes or read books (or papers).

- Members are expected to interact in both professional and social
  settings. Many solutions are discovered when people talk outside
  research laboratories. Communication with your team is an essential
  part of research. The social events are important parts of member
  interactions. If you do not want to participate in any social event,
  do not join this research team.

- This is a research team. It is not an amusement park. This team
  solves research problems and does not host tourists. Join this team
  only if you want to solve research problems. Spend at least six
  hours per week on the research project and attend weekly team
  meetings.

- Report progress in writing and speaking.  Research, by definition,
  is to discover new things. Thus, you must explain what you have
  discovered by speaking and writing.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------
  
- Q: It seems that you are discouraging people to join your team, why?
  Will anyone actually want to join?

- A: Too many people treat "research" as visiting an amusement
  park. They are looking for "fun" without the intention of taking
  efforts. They show up when they want to; they may leave at any
  moment. They expect to get A easily. This research team does not
  need those people. This research team welcomes only the people that
  are serious about solving research problems. Many people want to
  join this team because these people know everyone in this team is
  serious about solving research problems.

- Q: How many hours do I need to spend per week?

- A: **What do you want to accomplish?** You need to spend at least
  six hours a week. If you cannot, you are wasting your time because
  you can accomplish nothing.  Many people spend more than six hours a
  week. If you are leading a research paper, it is possible that you
  spend 30 hours (or more) the week before submission.


- Q: If I am selected, I will stay for at least two semesters, right?

- A: Not necessarily. The team may be reorganized. A particular topic
  may be eliminated if enough progress has been made. A member may be
  released (not "fired") if the member shows no progress.

- Q: Your team demands a lot. What do members get?

- A: Why do people climb high mountains? Why do people compete in
  World Cup? They want to accomplish something extraordinary.  This
  team gives members the pride of solving research problems,
  friendship with excellent researchers, authorship (or co-authorship)
  of research papers, strong recommendation letters, excellent job
  offers, and occasionally, pizza.

- Q: I do not want to take a research course because I already have
  too many credits.

- A: If you have too many credits, you will not have time doing
  research. You will definitely vanish when your coursework becomes
  heavy. Do not come.

- Q: This is my last semester and I do not want to take too many credits.

- A: If this is your last semester, you will not stay for two
  semester. Do not come.

- Q: I guarantee that I will stay, even though I do not take a research course.

- A: You will not stay. You know very clearly. You do not want to take
  a research course because you cannot spend time. Do not come. Many
  people "assured" that they would stay without taking credits.
  Everyone vanished. In fact, these people simply vanished without
  saying "Good Bye". This team does not need these people.

- Q: If you are so restrictive, how many people actually apply for joining the team?

- A: For Spring 2019, about 120 people wanted to join or stay in this
  team. This team's size has been growing rapidly in recent
  semesters. Many people want to join this team because they want to
  spend time with those that are serious about solving research
  problems.

- Q: Do you set a limit on the team's size?

- A: We welcome everyone that wants to solve research problems.  

About Financial Support
-----------------------

Most students do not know how universities operate in terms of
finance. As a result, they think professors magically have unlimited
funds to support as many students as the professors decide. Before you
ask Dr. Lu to provide financial support, please be aware of the
following facts:

- Dr. Lu does not print money. Research fund does not fall from sky like rain drops.
  
- Purdue University does not give students' tuition to professors for
  doing research. The tuition goes to facilities such as networks,
  buildings, furniture, electricity, staff, administration, cleaning
  ...
  
- For every $100 Dr. Lu spends on research (including machines, travel
  to conferences, salary for students ...), Purdue takes $55 for
  facilities such as networks, buildings, furniture, electricity,
  cleaning ... Thus, Dr. Lu has to request $155 from project sponsors.
  
- Purdue does not give research money to professors because the
  professors have a lot of students.
  
- Dr. Lu works with many students because he wants to give more
  students research experience. He enjoys the intellectual
  interactions with many excellent students. He also thinks the
  interactions among students help them succeed. The size of his
  research team has no effect on how much Purdue gives for research
  (always $0).
  
- Dr. Lu has zero influence about how Purdue spends tuition. Please
  talk to Purdue President if you have any suggestions.
  
- Dr. Lu has zero influence on other professors' decisions. Dr. Lu
  cannot tell any other professor to provide any student financial
  support.
  
- Dr. Lu obtains research funding by writing proposals.
  
- Financial supports are divided into three types: fellowship,
  teaching assistantship, and research assistantship. Dr. Lu has no
  control of fellowship or teaching assistantship.
  
- Research assistantship is a type of employment: a research assistant
  is an employee of Purdue University for conducting research
  described in the corresponding research proposal.  If you do not do
  what is written in the proposal, you cannot receive research
  assistantship.

- Professors provide research assistantship because the work in the
  proposals have to be carried out, not because professors are "nice".

Common Mistakes by Students
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Some students think "doing research" means disappearing for five
  years and coming back with world-changing discovery or invention.
  It does not work that way. You need to regularly (about once a week)
  report progress.
  
- Financial support is free money and students have complete freedom doing whatever they want.  
  
- Some students go to professors and say, "Give me money." They do not
  know that, in a bank office, this is called robbery and is a crime.
  
- Some students think sending emails to professors and money will be
  transferred to the students' bank accounts the next day.

How to Get Financial Support from Dr. Lu?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Understand that Dr. Lu has no obligation giving you financial support. You have to earn it.
  
- Getting financial support from Dr. Lu will take you a lot of efforts.
  
- Read at least five of his papers published in the last three
  years. Do not initiate any conversation before you finish reading
  the papers.
  
- Prepare to have multiple, long, and deep technical discussions.
  
- Dr. Lu has a large established research program. You must do what
  the research program needs.
  
- Dr. Lu can support only Purdue students.
  
- Dr. Lu emphasizes teamwork greatly. You have to work with a
  team. You must have good communication skills.

Interviews
----------

.. note::

   If you are not ready for an interview or you do not perform well in an interview, that's all right. Come back later.

.. warning::

   Do you like sports? Are you ready to join a professional team that
   compete internationally? This research team solves problems whose
   answers are not known to anyone in the world. We compete
   internationally.  We produce open-source software and data. We
   publish papers in top venues.


This research requires that every applicant be interviewed by two or
three current members. Why?  Any organization exists for a
purpose. The organization can succeed if the members can work together
toward the common goals. The organization fails if the members do not
understand the purpose of the organization or cannot work
together. Interviews are one of the methods to help determine whether
people interested joining the organization is ready to work together
with existing members toward the common goals.

A research group is fundamentally different from a classroom. A
research group aims to solve research problems that can help
humanity. A classroom is usually an inclusive environment: most
instructors allow auditors. In contrast, a research team is a
"privileged" environment and only selected members can participate.
Many reasons make research team restrictive, for example,

-  The members in the team use the facilities that are purchased
   using research fund.
   
-  The members must have ability to understand and improve
   state-of-the-art solutions.
   
-  The members are inventing a new solution that may lead to a
   patent. Before this patent is filed and granted, the members must  
   protect the intellectual properties.
   
-  The members are writing a research paper and everyone must be
   qualified to contribute to the content.

If you like sports, you need to ask yourself a simple qustion: "Am I
ready to join a professional team?" This research team is professional
because the team solves research problems that have not been solved by
anyone yet. If you are not ready to contribute, you will not enjoy the
experience and current team members cannot work with you.

This is a research team. You come to solve research problem. You do
not come to learn. If you want to learn, go to take courses or read
books.This team does not accept anyone that wants to join and learn,  
without contributions to solving research problems. This team accepts 
only the people that wants to solve research problems.The purpose of  
interviews is to help applicants and current members **evaluate
whether the applicants are ready to contribute.**

What is an interview?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An interview is a two-way communication: An organization wants to
determine whether an applicant should join the organization.
Meanwhile, this applicant also evaluates whether this organization is
worth the time and efforts. An interview usually evaluates three
aspects:(1) Communication skills, (2) Technical skills, (3)
Personality, honesty, and integrity.

If an applicant is not ready to join the group, it is possible that
this person can join later and contribute. This research team holds
honesty and integrity as the highest requirements.If an applicant is
not honest, this team will never accept the applicant. Communication
and technical skills can be acquired. Honesty and integrity cannot be
compromised.

Sample questions are listed below for your reference. Your are
encouraged to study these questions in advance.  You need to prepare
for the interview.

Differences between Students and Researchers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before an interview, please make sure you understand the differences
between students and researchers.  A student with high GPA is not
necessarily a good researcher. Some excellent researchers do not have
high GPA.  Why? Because taking classes are doing research are very
very different.

How does a student get a good grade? Usually, by submitting
assignments and answering exam questions. Due to the semester (or
quarter) structure, a course can last only 15 (or 10) weeks. As a
result, every assignment has to be finished within several
weeks. Also, most exam questions are limited to well-defined problems
that can be answered within one or two hours.  This structure has
tremendous impacts on how students think.  Many students (mistakenly)
think everything can be done within a few weeks because students never
have experience doing anything longer than a few weeks. Most students
cannot comprehend the complexity of any problem that takes more than
several weeks.

Unfortunately, research is almost the opposite of everything in
classroom. The following table summarizes the main differences between
"student thinking" and "researcher thinking":

Interview is not an oral exam
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Many students think interviews are oral exams: interviewers ask
questions and interviewees answer the questions. This is incorrect.
An interview is two-way communication. An interviewee should also ask
questions. To ask meaningful questions, an interviewee should study
the characteristics of the research team. Some students think
interview questions are “fill in the blank” and provide short answers,
without much explanation. Such an interviewee is “passive”: responding
to questions without deeper thought. Such an attitude would be
considered negative. It is advisable to dig deeper by providing more
insightful information. It is perfectly reasonable for an interviewee
to ask back “Why do you ask me this question?”

Do not intend to prepare an interview by memorization. Good
interviewers do not ask memorization questions. Dr. Lu *always* gives
open-book exams because he *strongly encourages* understanding, not
memorization. To enter Dr. Lu's research team, you need to demonstrate
that you can think. It is acceptable to say, “I don’t know.” and then
ask the interviewer to provide more information and guidance toward an
answer. A common mistake by students is to provide lengthy explanation
without answering the questions. Some students can take several
minutes without giving any definite answer.  Why? They are afraid
giving wrong answers. This is a bad attitude. It is better to answer
the question and then explain the reason of the answer. Interviewers
want answers before explanation. For a “Yes-No” question, answer “Yes”
or “No” first and then give the explanation.

Honesty is extremely important. An interviewee should never lie. If an
interviewee does not know the answer, it is acceptable to say, “I
don’t know the answer.” The interviewee should not pretend to know the
answer and say meaningless things. After admitting not knowing the
answer, an interviewee can try to answer the question through
reasoning. “I don’t know the answer but I think it should be … because
…” The “because” part is very important.

Sample Interview Questions
--------------------------

.. warning::

   You should never lie in an interview.


Teamwork
~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Communication and interaction is more important than any technical
   skill.  If you cannot communicate, it does not matter what you
   know.

How do you respond to discussion and critique?

 

Do you think using jargons and acronyms to ensure that nobody can
understand you would make people believe that you are knowledge,
smart, and superior?

 

How would you respond when someone tells you that you have made a
mistake?

 

When you disagree with someone, what would you do?

 

When someone disagrees with you, what would you do?

 

What would you do when you cannot finish a task that is assigned to
you?

 

What would you do when you finish a task early?

 

What would you do if a team member cannot finish an assigned task?

 

How would you inform team members your progress or problems you
encounter?

 

What would you do if you think an assigned task is not worth doing,
or should be done in a different way?

 

Have you participated in a project in which members’ responsibilities 
were adjusted as needs arose?

 

Have you worked in a team project? How big was the team?

 

Can you describe the ideal characteristics of team members? Are you a
good team member? Why?

 

Did you have experience working with a difficult team member? Why is  
this member difficult? What did you (or anyone else in the team) do
to manage the situation?

 

How would you handle the situation when a team member is intelligent, 
highly-motivated, has solid technical skills but does something that  
is not the team’s priority?

 

When a team member writes a report that does not provide sufficient
details for you to work together, what would you do? How would you
prevent this from happening?

 

Past Project Experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

Show evidence of your past projects. What did you do? Is it an
individual project or a team project? What are your contributions?

 

What knowledge and skills do you have? Why do you think you can
contribute to the project?

 

Can you describe the factors that made your past projects successful
or unsuccessful?

 

If you could redesign one of your past projects from the beginning,
what differences would you make?

 

Logic Thinking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

Alice is younger than Bob. Bob is younger than Cathy. Thus, Alice is  
definitely younger than Cathy.

 

Alice and Bob are friends. Bob and Cathy are friends. Thus, Alice and 
Cathy are definitely friends.

 

It has been observed that owners of luxurious vehicles are richer
than average people. Thus, if a person wants to become rich, this
person should purchase a luxurious vehicle.

 

Alice says, “If an event is observed, it is definitely possible.” Bob 
says, “The opposite is also true. If an event is never observed, it
is definitely impossible.” Which one is correct? Alice? Bob? Both?
Neither?

 

A pharmaceutical company wants to understand the effects of a new
medicine. The researchers give this new medicine to lab animals and
nothing else. Within six days, all lab animals are dead. The
researchers conclude that the medicine is toxic and should never be
used for treatment. Do you agree with this conclusion? Explain your
answer.

 

Algorithms and Discrete Mathematics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

Briefly describe binary search.

 

How is binary search done in a sorted array? How is binary search
done in a binary search tree?

 

What is the best case (in terms of time or the number of operations)  
when doing binary search in a sorted array? What is the worst case
when doing binary search in a sorted array?

 

What is the best case when doing binary search in a binary search
tree? What is the worst case when doing binary search in a binary
search tree?

 

In a graph with positive weights for the edges, describe an algorithm 
to find the shortest path between two vertices. Hint: “Dijistra’s
algorithm” is not an acceptable answer. An acceptable answer must
describe how the algorithm works.

 

Suppose you have an algorithm that finds the shortest paths in a
graph of positive weights for edges. Would the algorithm find the
longest paths, without cycles, in a graph of positive weights for
edges if you replace “>” by “<=” or “>” by “>=”? Explain the reason.  

 

Continue from the previous question. Describe an algorithm to find
the longest path between two vertices without any cycle. Why is it
important to emphasize that cycles are not allowed?

Hint: Changing "<" in the algorithm for shortest paths to ">" would not
work. Please explain the reason.

 

Why is quicksort quick?

 

Data structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


It is expected that every student in his group has the programming
skills described in his book “Intermediate C Programming” (CRC Press, 
ISBN 9781-4987-11630). Knowledge about the following topics would be  
helpful: data structures, discrete mathematics, algorithms, computer  
architecture, operating systems, and networks.

 

Binary tree is a widely used data structure. Why is “binary”
sufficient? Is trinary tree better? In what ways? Why do most books
not emphasize trinary tree?

 

Describe two ways in a computer program to store a graph. Explain the 
advantage and disadvantage of these two ways.

 

Describe two sorting algorithms. Explain the advantage and
disadvantage of these two algorithms.

 

You need to design sorting algorithms for two different scenarios.

#. The machine has a very large amount of memory (with uniform access 
   time) and all data can fit into the memory.

#. The amount of data exceeds the memory capacity and thus only part  
   of the data can fit in memory. The rest of the data must reside on 
   much slower disks.

Would the sorting algorithms be different for these two scenarios?
Why? How?

 

Describe the most important difference between a linked list and a
binary tree. Why is this the most important?

 

What are the differences between a list and an associate array? When  
would you use one or the other?

 

How would you implement an associative array?

 

Two binary tree have the same shape if they have the same numbers of
nodes on the left and the right sides at each level. For `n` distinct
numbers, there are `n!` different permutations. If these numbers form
binary search trees, how many different shapes will there be? Is that
`n!`?

 

How would you store a very large matrix whose most elements are zero?
What matrix operations would be easy in this data structure? What
operations would be more difficult? Why?

 

Programming (independent of language)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

What is stack memory? How is it used?

 

What is heap memory? How is it used?

 

When would you use recursion? You can describe general principles or  
examples. When is recursion better than `for` (or `while`) for solving
problems? Hint: the Fibonacci sequence, `f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)`, is
not a good example of recursion. Please read Section 13.6 in
“Intermediate C Programming”.

 

What is memory leak? Why is it a problem?

 

What is call by value? What is call by reference?

 

What is unit test? What is integration test?

 

What version control tool do you use? What is the purpose of version
control?

 

Explain how you debug programs.

 

C Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 
.. code-block:: c

   int  * iptr;  /* what is the size of iptr? */
   char * cptr;  /* what is the size of cptr? */

   char x = 'm';
   int * iptr = &x;

What is wrong with this two lines? What problems could this cause?


.. code-block:: c

   void f(void)
   {
      f();
   }


What would happen when `f()` is called?

What is encapsulation? Why is it important?

 

What is inheritance? How can it be used?

 

What is polymorphism? How is it used?

Briefly explain the difference between TCP and UDP.

 

If you need to write a pair of programs to send and receive files,
what network protocol would you use? Options include (but are not
limited to) TCP, UDP, HTTP, SSL, Wifi. Explain your answer.

 

What is the fastest network (in terms bytes per second) today? What
is the data rate?

 

What is the data rate (in terms of bytes of second) if a cargo ship
carries 100,000 of hard disks cruising at 36 km/h?

 

.. note::

   If a candidate knows C++ or Java, the candidate should answer the following questions.


C++ 
~~~

 

Explain the purpose of virtual.

 

What is a copy constructor? In what condition can the default copy
constructor be used? In what condition must a programmer write a
different copy constructor? Hint: understand the difference between
shallow and deep copy.

 

Is every valid C program also a valid C++ program? Explain your
answer. Hint: Many people answer this question without thinking.
Consider the keywords in C and in C++.

 

Explain the difference of call by value and call by reference for C++ 
programs.
