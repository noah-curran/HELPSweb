HOW TO (For Current Members)
============================

How To Choose Research Topics
-----------------------------

Choose Now, So That You Can Choose Again
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A common problem among many students (in fact, most people) is that they cannot decide. Many people hesitate to choose because they are afraid of choosing something wrong and then regret later. Some studies suggest that people feel less happy when they have more options. In some retail experiments, customers leave without buying anything if too many items are on sale. 

Many students say, "I don't know what I want to do. Thus, I am not going to choose." This thinking is wrong in multiple ways:

- First, you have already chosen a major. 
- Second, you have already chosen to study at Purdue University.
- Third, you have already chosen to join Dr. Lu's research team.
- Fourth, you have already chosen to read this page right now.

Everything has a cost. The highest cost is time because nothing can get time back. When you are reading this page right now, you have already been spending the most precious resource of your life: time. You have already made the decision to spend this moment this way.

When students join research teams, they may face the options of choosing topics. Here are some common misunderstanding about choosing research topics:

- Students decide research topics. Some students think research means
  disappearing from civilization for several years, coming out "crazy
  ideas", and completely changing the world after they reappear giving
  the final oral presentations. This is wrong. First, it is unlikely
  that you can disappear from civilization; you still need access to
  the Internet, right? Second, it is unlikely that you can come out
  crazy ideas alone. Third, even if you can come out crazy ideas, you
  need to validate the ideas and compare them with existing
  studies. Maybe some people have already done similar things.
  
- If a student chooses a topic, the student cannot change the topic
  for the next forty years. Once in a while, a person makes a major
  breakthrough in science and gives a speech about the processs to the
  success. The person may say, "I have been solving this problem for
  forty years since I was a student."  These cases are rare (that's
  why they are reported in news). It is common that a research changes
  topics as technologies become mature, new technologies (and
  problems) are created, or simply because these researchers change
  their interests.

The most important factor of deciding research topics is the needs of
the research teams, not a student's preference. A research team is
often similar to a baseball team. If the team needs a left field now,
you have to fill that position, or you are out of the team. The
research topics are decided by professors according to multiple
factors, for example, the existing expertise of the teams, the
projection of the teams' future needs, etc. It is rare that a
professor allows a student to choose a topic without any
boundary. Sometimes news reports major breakthroughs in science or
technologies and says the people have been working on solving the same
problems for decades. What is covered in news is rare; common
situations are not covered in news. In other words, most researchers
change topics over their careers.

Many students think not choosing any topic gives them the freedom to
choose something else later. This is also wrong for multiple reasons:

- If you do not choose a research topic now, you may have no options
  later. If you want to attend a graduate school, research experience
  can be very helpful getting admissions (and financial supports). If
  you do not choose a topic, you may not receive the admission from
  the university you want to attend. As a result, you do not have the
  option of attending that university.

- If you do not choose a research topic now, you may not stand out in
  job interviews. As a result, you do not have the option of joining
  the company you like.

- Most important, if you do not choose a topic now, you may never know
  which topic you actually like.  If you are an outsider, you do not
  know the good and bad things about a particular research topic. As a
  result, you have no information to make the best decision for you.

"How to choose a topic?", you may ask. The best answer is **"Just do
it"**. The best way to know whether you like a research topic is to
start doing it. Read research papers. Repeat the experiments. Derive
the formulas. Talk to the people doing this research. Just do it. You
will likely determine, within a few weeks, whether you really hate it.
If you do not do it, you will never know whether you like it or not.

Choice is a Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some people imagine that they could choose the best pieces among
different options. That is usually not possible. If you like to travel
around the world, you have to tolerate flight delays, jetlags, etc. If
you like to live in a city, you have to tolerate traffic. Every choice
is a "package". Everything in the package comes together. Each
research team has specific culture and style of doing research. Some
teams emphasize teamwork. Some other teams encourage students to work
independently. Some professors usually write short papers (2-4
pages). Some professors usually write long papers (10 pages or
longer). Some professors' papers have many equations. Some professors'
papers have no equation. Some professors expect students to appear
during daytime; some other professors do not care if students appear
only between dinner and breakfast.  Some research teams need to write
software. Some research teams need field studies. When you join a
research team, you embrace all these into your topic.

Do Not Chase "Hot" Topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many students choose "hot" topics. They choose topics based on the popular terms in news. This has many problems. First, a hot topic means many people are working on it. When these students graduate, there may be over supply of talents and jobs may be hard to find. Second, a hot topic must be a hard topic. Easy things cannot be hot because everyone can do it and there is nothing to talk about. That means a hot topic takes a lot of effort to understand and to master.

Hot topics inevitably becomes cold.

Spend some time understanding the history of a research topic. Some
topics become hot, cold, hot, cold over multiple decades. A topic may
be hot for a while, many people work on the topic and solve easy
problems.  Then, the remaining problems are too hard and people stop
(hence, the topic becomes cold). Some years later, a major
breakthrough occurs and the topic becomes hot again. You need to
understand these cycles. Breakthroughs are made by those people that
are willing to continue when the topic becomes cold and most people
have left that topic.

When you choose a research topic, you need to know your personality. Do you like more conceptual problems, or you prefer something tangible? You also need to know the restrictions imposed on you. If you have two semesters before graduation, you should not intend to solve a problem at the scale of a doctoral thesis. In most cases, students do not have the knowledge or experience choosing the right scale of problems. They should discuss with professors.

Understand the Four Stages of Doing Research
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It has been observed that most students go through four stages when they do research:

- Excitement due to ignorance. Students are always excited when they
  encounter new research problems. They have not started and have not
  encounter any obstacles. They are ready to change the world by their
  endless energy and unlimited optimism.

- Frustration and disappointment with knowledge. The first stage may
  last several days to several weeks. After reading research papers,
  the students lose excitement. They realize "Everything I want to do
  has been done."  The more they read, the more frustrated they
  become. They conclude that they are late about everything. Anything
  that is worth doing has already been published.

- Experiments and failures. The second stage may last several weeks to
  many months. Most students give up during the second stage. Some
  students think deeply enough and move to the third stage. They
  identify things that have not been published. They think of ways to
  improve existing solutions. They try these improvements and compare
  these new methods with existing methods. The new methods do not work
  at all, or are worse than the existing methods.

- Improvement and innovation. The third stage may last several months
  to forever. Reading more papers usually does not help getting out of
  the third stage. Staying in office or laboratory is often not
  productive. Improvements and innovations usually come from
  non-routine activities: attend a seminar, do exercise, watch a
  sci-fi movie, talk to strangers, listen to podcast, take a short
  vacation, attend a conference ... Research has shown that people are
  more innovative when they break their daily routines.

How to get out of Stage 2 and Stage 3? There is no method that always
works. Here are several suggestions that can help:

- Talk to experts. If you find a paper that is truly inspiring,
  contact the first author and ask whether you can talk by vidoe call
  for 10 minutes. Of course, you have to read the paper very carefully
  and understand most of the context. Don't ask trivial
  questions. Instead, ask questions about directions, such as "What
  direction would you suggest to take?" "What mistakes would you
  suggest to avoid?" Use you @purdue.edu email. DO NOT USE @gmail.com.
  Studies have shown that strangers are more willing (about three
  times more) to help students. If you use @purdue.edu, you increase
  your chance of response to about 15%. If you use @gmail.com, you
  have only 5% chance getting responses.
  
- Pay attention to details. Maybe all existing studies use images
  taken indoors. If you use outdoor images, will anything change?
  Maybe published studies are conducted on sunny days. If you do the
  study on a rainy day, will anything change?

- Create a table comparing different methods. What are similar and
  different among the published methods?

- Repeat published studies. You may get different results because you
  take slightly different approach and the details are not
  published. Discover the differences.

Read biographies of great inventors. Learn how they solve problems.

Talk to People
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Academia has many studies that are completely irrelevant and nobody
cares.  Why? Some researchers imagine some problems, solve these
problems, and publish papers. Some other researchers read the papers
and improve the solutions. Over years, many papers are published on
these topics but thes results will never be adopted in the "real
world".

It is certainly admirable pursuing knowledge for the sake of
knowledge, and nothing else. However, if you think you are solving a
problem to help people, you need to know whether people actually care
about that problem.

Many studies have been conducted about how to identify worthwhile
problems to solve. One method is to talk to people "in the field". If
you think you are solving a problem important to some people, find
these people and talk to them. They may tell you the problem is indeed
important, or not.  You need to talk to strangers, not your family
members, classmates, or friends. Strangers are more likely to be
honest to you, giving you answers you do not like (such as, "I do not
care about this problem.").


Go to Linkedin and find these people. Talk to them for 5-10 minutes by
video or phone call. Often, you need to talk many people before you
converge to a problem worth solving. Some studies suggest that you
need to talk to 100 people to determine whether a problem is worth
solving:

- The first 20-30 people help you understand what questions you want to ask

- The next 20-30 people help you identify the right people to ask

- Another 20-30 people help you narrow down the problem to something
  specific and avoid distractions (related but unimportant problems)

- Finally, 20-30 more people help you identify the most important
  problem to solve

How long does this process take? If you talk to 3-4 people per day, you
will spend about 3 months.

"This is a total waste of time", you may say.

The question is what would happen if you do not ask these questions.

If you do not ask these questions, you may spend several years solving
a problem and nobody cares what you have done.

An efficient way meeting many people is to attend a large conference
or a trade show. You may talk to 20 people on a single day.

**This research team encourages you to talk to people.** Take notes in
every conversation. If you talk to 100 people, you will have the
confidence that you have identified a problem that is worth your time
solving.

"Fail Fast"
~~~~~~~~~~~

One concept from the business world is to "Fail Fast": Do not select a
very complex problem that requires many years to solve.  Instead,
breaking this complex problem into many small problems and determine
how to evaluate success often and quickly.  Every small problem helps
you determine whether you are in the right direction or not.

Researchers can learn from the movie industry: Before selecting casts
and picking up cameras, a movie studio first draw a *story board*
illustrating the plot of a story.  The story is discussed whether this
story is worth developing. If this is not an attractive story, stop
and consider a different story. If this story is worth pursuing some
more details are added.  After a lot of details have already been
figured out by drawing the story board, the studio starts selecting
casts and crew.  A story board allows researchers to evaluate many
problems without investing a lot of time to each.

Another concept from business is "Fake it before you make it." Imagine
that you can to build a computer program with user interfaces.  You
can first build the front page with buttons, textboxes, menu...
*without* building anything else.  Show this front page to potential
users.  It is possible that nobody likes the user interface and nobody
will use the program.  It is unnecessary building the rest of the
program because there is no user. When you build a complex system, you
need to build a few small parts, "fake" some unbuilt parts so that you
can test what has already been built. If you do not fake those parts,
you cannot test what you have built.

The concept of "fail fast" forces researchers to think critically what
is the most important and evaluate whether that is indeed worth
doing. Make a little progress and then evaluate again. In many cases,
"great ideas" are not worth pursuing because nobody cares (other than
writing papers citing each other's work).


Why Don't Professors Just Give Prolems to Students?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some students want professors to give problems, like homework
assignments in classrooms. This is not ideal because nobody (even
"professors") can know all the most recent progress.  The ability to
identify a problem worth solving is an important skill for students to
learn.  Students need to become thinkers, not only doers.



How To Give Progress Reports
----------------------------

Research is fundamentally different from classroom learning. Please review
(you should have already read it before joining this team)


Differences Between Progress Reports and Homework Assignments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rogress reports are not homework assignments. The following table compares the difference

+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Research Progress Reports                                  | Homework Assignments                                   |
+============================================================+========================================================+
| Each team member solves unique problems                    | Everyone solves the same problem                       |
+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Need to explain how to evaluate success                    | Grading criteria are given by professors               |
+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Often encounter unexpected obstacles and take long time    | Assignments can usually be done within a few days      |
+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Why? Explain to the team                                   | Why? Professors assign the problems                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| What? Explain to the team                                  | What? Professors assign the problems                   |
+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| To inform other members of the progress and difficulty     | To inform the instructor that "I know the answer."     |
+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| A research problem cannot be solved easily                 | Most homework problems can be solved by studying       |
+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Require a lot of thinking                                  | Attend lectures, read textbooks, talk to TAs           |
+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

Due to these differences, students often make the following mistakes when giving progress reports:

- Give too little information: Since everyone is doing the same thing,
  everyone knows everything and there is no need to say anything.

- Hide "failure": Most homework problems are supposed to be solvable
  within a few days (at most several weeks) after studying. If a
  student cannot solve a research problem quickly, the student does
  not want to talk about the difficulty.

- Lack documentation: If everyone knows everything and answers are in
  textbooks, there is no need to document activities.

A very common scenario is when a student tries a few things and does
not get expected results. During progress report, the student says
only one sentence, "My progress report is that I tried a few things
and they did not work."  This student does not understand the precious
information about

- What has been tried?

- Why are these things worth trying?

- What are the expected results? How to define "working"?

- What are the evidence "they did not work"?

- What information can be obtained from these activities? What lessons are learned?

- What actions will the student take next?

Most students do not know that the unexpected results (do not call
them "failure") form the foundation of new discoveries or invention.
The unexpected results provide precious information.

Here are four essential elements in progress reports

- What problem are you solving?
  
- **Why** are you solving this problem? How is it relevant to the team's purpose?

- What have you done? What is the result? What is the evidence?

- How do you do the problem? **Why** do you do it this way?

You need to provide details. Use figures, drawings, photos, equations, screenshots, source code ... to explain.

Many students focus exclusively on "how" to solve the problems without
knowing the reason why the problems are worth solving. Very often,
when asked "Why are you doing this?", students say, "I don't
know. This problem is given by the professor."

It is extremely important understanding "why" before asking "how".

Distinguish "Solving a Problem" from "Fixing a Solution"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Too often, people are confused between "solving a problem" and "fixing
a solution". Here are two examples explaining the differences.

Imagine that you are going to take a vacation and a friend will take
you to the airport. Several hours before your flight, your friend's
car breaks down.  You say, "I can fix your car." It turns out fixing
the car takes longer than expected and you miss the flight.  "How can
anyone be so stupid?", you may ask. "Too many".  The "problem" is that
you need transportation to the airport for your flight. One (among
many) solution is ask to this particular friend to give you a ride to
the airport. There are many other solutions for the problem (going to
the airport for the flight), such as asking another friend, taking a
bus, or calling a taxi. However, you completely focus on this
particular solution and want to fix the solution (repairing the car).

You want to make a graph showing the results from an experiment.  You
are very familiar with a computer tool. You recently purchase a new
computer and your familiar tool does not run on the new computer. You
spend several hours install, remove, install again this tool. You
search online why this tool does not run your new computer. You erase
the entire computer, install a new operating system, and install the
tool again. What is the problem? The problem is to show the
experimental results. Your familiar tool for making a graph is one
possible solution.  You spend several hours fixing this solution but
you can use many other possible solutions, such as making a table,
using another tool, or simply looking at the data and hand draw the
figure.

Ask yourself often whether you are solving a problem or fixing a
solution.  If it is the latter, are there other solutions? If there
are (usually there are), why do you stay with the current solution
that needs to be fixed? Can you choose another solution?


Honesty, Integrity, and Trust
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Honesty, integrity, and trust are the foundation of research. Never lie. Never fake data.

It is understandable that you encounter problems that are harder than expected. It is understandable that your other commitment may prevent you from making enough progress. It is understandable that unexpected things happen. Be honest. If you have not made progress, tell the truth. If something does not work, explain what happens.

Why? What? Then How?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Students usually focus exclusively on *how* to solve
problems. Students usually do not ask *why* nor *what*. When asked
"Why are you doing this?", many students would say, "I don't know. The
professor told us to do this." When asked, "What are you doing?  Can
you describe it?", many students would say, "I am following the
instructions given by the professor."

When professors teach large classes, it is often necessary giving
homework assignments with precise requirements so that students
understand what to do.  As explained earlier, research is very
different from classroom. Researchers need explain why first so that
others understand the motivation.  Then, researchers need to explain
what the problems are and what actions are taken for solving the
problems. After explaining why and what, then the methods to solve the
problems can make sense.


Know the Purpose and Audience, Then Practice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Here is a list of suggestions about giving good presentations:
- Know the audience.
- Practice. Make sure all content can be explained clearly. The connections among different materials need to be logic and smooth.
- Meaure time. A speech should uses approximatley 80% total time and leave 20% for QA. If the presentation is 15 minutes, speak for 12 minutes and leave 3 minutes for QA. 
- Start with a clear title and your name. The title should be the problem you are solving.
- Explain details. You must be an expert in solving the specific problems. Provide details so that others can learn from you.
- Use visual aids effectively. Use figures, drawings, photos, equations, screenshots, source code ... to explain. DO NOT USE A LOT OF WORDS.
- Remove all irrelevant decoration (anything that is irrelevant to the research problem or your contributions). 


How to Get Good Grades in Research?
-----------------------------------

Research is very very (very very) different from classroom
learning. Learning focuses on getting knowledge and skills into
you. Research focuses on creating something new, new to everyone in
the world, not new to you only. In many cases, classroom learning
means attending lectures, taking notes, read textbooks, submitting
homeworks, answering exam questions. It is possible not getting a good
grade without saying a single word in a class.  Research has *none* of
these.  There is no lecture, textbooks, exam questions.  Instead, you
need to think about how to evaluate your work.  **Communication is
extremely important in research.**

Expectations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Each person is expected to attend the weekly meetings. Absence must
  be reported to the team leader and Dr. Lu by email.  Having an exam
  is an acceptable reason **only** if the exam is held at the same
  time of the meeting. It is not acceptable if the exam is on the same
  day at a different time.

- During the weekley meetings, each person has to report progress for
  3-5 minutes: What has been done? Why should it be done? What is the
  result? Please provide details.  It is **not** acceptable saying "It
  does not work." as a progress report.

- Approximately near the middle of a semester, each person needs to
  give a presentation (8-10 minutes) explaining the problem this
  person is solving, not the problem for the team.  The presentation
  must provide enough details about the problem, the reason why this
  problem needs to be solved, the relationship between this problem
  and the team's goals, and the planned approach.

- Approximately near the middle of a semester, each person needs to
  fill a peer evaluation of the team members. This is an opportunity
  to find the members that have performed well or poorly.

- Before the semester ends, each person needs to give a presentation
  (15-20 minutes) about the results. This presentation needs to
  include three important things: **details, details, and details**.
  What has been done? How is the method evaluated? What are the
  results?  If something "works", please provide evidence. If
  something is "better", please provide detailed comparison.  If
  something "does not work", please provide diagnosis. Remember
  **details**.  It is absolutely required that the presenter practices
  in advance. Everything on every slide must be carefully explained.
  It is acceptable if you include code, as long as you explain.  It is
  strongly discouraged that you types words in slides.  Slides are
  "visual aids": showing things that cannot be said easily. Slides
  should show figures, images, equations, tables, .... **not words**.




Common Mistakes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The undergraduate program at Purdues does not require research. Hence, you should join a research team only if you want to solve research programs. You need to make progress in solving research problems. 

One of the most difficult parts of being a beginning researcher is to understand how progress is measured. Let's first review what students typically do in classrooms: attend lectures, take notes, submit homework assignments, answer exam questions. In many (probably most) cases, all students in the same classes have the same homework assignments and the same exam questions. This is the source of a lot of confusion for many students: they think everyone in the world is solving exactly the same problem described in the homework or the exams. The implication is that many students deeply believe that everyone in the world is solving exactly the same problem. Everyone knows the problem. Everyone has read the same textbooks. Everyone has seen the same exam questions. Also, professors are supposed to know the answers because professors write the homework assignments and the exam questions. 

No organization will put 100 people sitting together solving the same problem and the answer is already known by the "instructor". 

In many cases, students can get good grades without speaking a word in class. In fact, some students think speaking (asking questions or answering questions) disrupt lectures and should be discouraged.

"Classroom environment is not real." Please read it 10 times and understand the implications. 

Many students never realize that classroom environment is not real. Many students would be completely surprised that other people solve different problems and that professors do not have answers ready for research problems.

If you are in a research team, you must become an expert in the problem you are solving and nobody else should know as much as you do. If someone else knows as much as you (or more than you), by definition, you are unnecessary and should solve a different problem.



How To Work in a Team
---------------------


One of the most important difference between doing class homework and 
research is the need of “team thinking”. You are part of a team and
your must contribute to the team. Many students make significant
progress in their computers but they do not share what they have done 
with the team. As a result, whatever they have done is restricted to  
themselves.

What does it mean sharing work with the team? At the minimum, each
member should document contributions

Document Your Work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to clearly document everything you want to do, you have
done, and the results. One of the most common mistakes when students  
start doing research is that “student thinking”: as long as I have
learned, I don’t need to document. This is wrong.

You are responsible explaining to the other group members that you
are doing. Your document must provide enough details so thatother
people can reproduce your work.



How To Become a Team Leader
---------------------------

*I was writing a chapter of Beautiful Evidence on the subject of the sculptural pedestal, which led to my thinking about what's up on the pedestal - the great leader.* - Edward Tufte

One of the speacial parts of this research team is the comprehensive leadership development program. The experience of leading a research team can define your career for many years after you graduate from Purdue.

The CAM2 team has two types of leaders:

- Project leader: A leader manages a specific project (for example, active learning, drone video, crowdsourcing ...). A project leader needs to know the project's goal (write a research paper, build software, create data ...) and guide members toward the goal. A leader needs to know enough about different parts of the project but does not need to know all details of everyone's work. A project leader is a technical leader.
- CAM2 leader: The CAM2 team has multiple project and tne entire team needs a leader. The CAM2 leader needs to think about the entire team strategically, for example, how to recruit and screen new members and how to reorganize future projects. The CAM2 leader represents all project leaders and communicate with the advisers. It is typical that the CAM2 leader is also a project leader.

Benefits of Being a Leader 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You get the opportunity to develop the skills that cannot be obtained in classrooms. In classrooms, most students are used to "mind their own business". Their success depends only on their own abilities and efforts. A leader's success depends on the team members. This is a completely different experience and requires new sets of skills.
- Leading a research project or the entire research team gives you new prospects about how to interact with people (team members, other leaders, professors, external collaborators, sponsors ...).
- Leaders need to understand their members: their abilities, their long-term aspiration, their short-term constraints.
- Leaders need to understand the projects' and the team's needs, such as paper deadlines.
- A leader has to think about the project's needs and plan ahead.  
- If the research project publishes a conference paper, the leader is the first choice to present the paper. 
- If you need recommendation letters from the advisers, the letters will be much, much, much stronger if you are an excellent leader. 


- Talk to the advisers, often. The leaders are selected by the advisers. If you do not talk to the advisers, you will not be selected.
- Talk to team members often and know their skills. 
- In most cases, new members are not leaders. A leader has to be in the project for at least one semester.


How to Get Strong Letters of Recommendation
-------------------------------------------

Helping students succeed is one of the missions of university professors. Dr. Lu writes recommendation letters for graduate schools, awards, jobs, etc. Before you ask Dr. Lu to write a letter for you, please ask yourself these question:

- Does Dr. Lu know me well?
- Do I have something special to be recommended?
- Can Dr. Lu write a strong letter for me?
- Does he have time writing a letter for me?

If you answer No to any question, STOP. Don't waste your time. If you took his class but never talked to him, he knows nothing about you and has nothing to recommend. Your grade is already in the transcript. If the only thing Dr. Lu can write is about your grade, the letter does not help you. Thus, Dr. Lu will not write a letter for you.

`This video <https://youtu.be/VMnzmM93W0s>`__ explains how recommendation letters work for applications of graduate schools. Please watch.

Dr. Lu writes letters for a student only after talking to the student. **If you want a letter from him, you have to talk to him.** If you are not on Purdue campus, please schedule a video call.

Do not ask Dr. Lu to write a letter because you cannot find anyone else. It is your problem, not Dr. Lu's. 

Dr. Lu's letters always focus on accomplishments. You need to provide
evidence of your accomplishments. "I really enjoy your class" is not
an accomplishment and Dr. Lu cannot write a letter because a student
enjoys his class. "I do not know who else to ask" is not an
accomplishment and Dr. Lu cannot write a letter for this reason.

When you ask Dr. Lu for a letter, he will always ask you the following questions (because graduate schools ask them). Please bring your answers **with evidence** (such as your project reports).

- Your ability to speak and write. You can answer this question by giving an excellent technical presentation and a well-written technical document.

- Your ability to work in teams.

You must give Dr. Lu at least three weeks to write your letter.  When
you ask him to write, you must give him a list of universities you
want to apply. He will send letters to only these universities. You
must send all applications **within one week**.

You do not decide the content of the letters.  Dr. Lu will **never**
say anything if he has no supporting evidence. Dr. Lu will **never** sign a
letter written by you.

Some students think sending email to professors is the only needed
action for getting recommendation letters. This is not true for
Dr. Lu. Dr. Lu works with individual students and writes many details
in the letters. If you are unwilling spending time with him through
this process, do not ask him to write letters.  Every letter must have
a known destination.

You are busy. So is everyone.  Your time is precious. So is his.

How To Arrange Business Trips
-----------------------------

Please work with Gabby Rainwater in MSEE 268 and 
Christy Millen in MSEE 112.

Purdue Rules about Travel:

- `Air Travel <https://www.purdue.edu/business/travel/Transportation/Air_Travel/airfaretravel.html>`__

- `Lodging <https://www.purdue.edu/business/travel/Lodging/index.html>`__

- `Ground Transportation <https://www.purdue.edu/business/travel/Transportation/Car/index.html>`__

  
Some general principles in arranging trips:

- Use your judgment. Balance among safety, convenience, comfort, and cost.

- Use money wisely. Do not think "This is not my money. I am going to
  spend as much as possible." Research fund is not easy to get. If you
  spend too much money on travel, less money can be used for other
  things (such as a new machine or another business trip).

- Your time is precious. Do not spend a lot of time looking for cheap
  airfare or inexpensive hotels. Do not choose a cheap hotel that
  requires long commute to your business destination. Do not choose a
  very longover to save a few dollars.

- Safety is your highest priority.  If you feel unsafe, take
  reasonable actions to reduce the chance of harm (stay in the
  conference hotel, call a taxi, ...)

- Take advantage of the local opportunities. Can you visit a
  collaborator or a sponsor in the same city?

- Make as many friends as possible.  The main reason for you to travel
  is to meet people. Talk to them. Learn what they are doing. Ask them
  questions. Do not hide at corners and wish you are invisible (many
  students do that). You will not be eaten if you say, "Hello, I am
  from Purdue University. Can you tell me more about your recent
  research?"


How To Write a Research Paper
-----------------------------

First, forget everything about your "semester papers". These are not
real research papers.  A research paper typically takes one or two
*years* (not weeks, not months) to write. If you want to write a
research paper quickly, this team is not for you.
